## Information about the game

This is a simplified version of the Board Game. Each player represents a man who manages his dynasty. Each player keeps his / her cards 
in their predetermined areas of the table depending on their function or condition, for example it uses two card decks to draw new cards,
his "hand" to activate cards on a specific phase of the game, four (4) cards representing its provinces of the dynasty etc.. The purpose 
of the player is to destroy the rest of the players' provinces keeping at least one of his up. The one deck, called fate deck, contains 
green cards that represent actions available to the player, which he holds in his hand and plays at a relative stage of the game. The 
other deck, called dynasty deck, contains black cards which represent great personalities or properties are part of the dynasty and are placed in an area in front of the player.
